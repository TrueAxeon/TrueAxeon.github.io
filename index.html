                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Greetings! My name is Danylo Shapovalov, and I am an aspiring Software Engineer with experience varying from robotics to web development. I am from Ukraine, but I have been living and studying in the US since 2012. I got my Bachelor's degree in Physics & Astronomy from Emory University in 2018, and my Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from West Virginia University in 2020. My hobbies include gaming, music production and audio engineering. I have also attemted to get a second Master's in Computer Science, but that was when the war in Ukraine broke out, which had a large financial impact on me and forced to withdraw. However, I have continued studying on my own since then!</p>
